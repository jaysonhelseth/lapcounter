# lapcounter
Make a fun lap counter for tracking how many laps I walk/run in my basement.

### Hardware
I have looked through the sensors and soc's I have laying around. I think that my first attempt will be using a Raspberry Pi 3 b+, a sunfounder PIR sensor and a display.

### Software
I will either use python and qt for the gui, or golang and fyne.io for the gui.

### Plan
The current plan is to have the PIR sensor in a location where it will only see where I cross the "finish" line and not see me anywhere else on the course.
